# 3d-Grapher

## Simple. Fast. Accurate.
The flexibility you need in a simple framework designed to accomodate everything from scene rendering to vector fields.
Here's what you can do:
 - Multiple Perspectives (see `rotationSpeed`)
 - 3d Animations (update mathematical models as they are being rotated)
 - Vector Fields (see vector_field_grapher.js)
 - Scene Lighting (move `light_source`)
 - Surface Plotting (see surface_grapher.js)
 
Everything can be described mathematically [1] (graph of x, y axes, parametric, etc.) or as a more natural series of planes [2] stacked on top of each other to form basic shapes (i.e. a cube). This flexibility allows for faster 3d graphics and speeds up the design process immensely.
